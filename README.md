Analyzing the influence of actor names on movie posters using business experimentation &amp; causal methods 

Introduction
Horror movie posters are designed to evoke fear through unsettling imagery, dark color schemes,
and ominous taglines. However, beyond these visual elements, textual cues - such as the
presence of actor names - may also shape audience perception. Familiar actors can create a sense
of recognition and comfort, potentially reducing the psychological impact of the fear-inducing
elements within the poster. This effect may be particularly pronounced when the actors are not
strongly associated with the horror genre. Given this, we hypothesize that the inclusion of actor
names on horror movie posters decreases the perceived scariness of the film. This study aims to
explore how this factor influences audience expectations and emotional responses to horror
movie marketing.

Research Question
How does the presence of actor names on movie posters affect the perception of scariness of the
movie?

Hypothesis
The presence of actor names on movie posters will decrease the perceived scariness of the
movie, as compared to the actor names being absent from the movie poster.
